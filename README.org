#+TITLE: improved_zero_forcing
Data set for the paper "Improved computational approaches and heuristics for zero forcing."

* Data Format

Each file defines a graph in edge list format, where the first row is the number of vertices and edges "V E" and each further row defines an edge in the form "v_1 v_2".

** Example Graph: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_graph][Butterfly Graph]]

The following shows what the file would look like for the butterfly graph with vertices 0,...,4.
