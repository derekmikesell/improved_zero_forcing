#+TITLE: improved_zero_forcing
Set of instances and results for the paper "Improved computational approaches and heuristics for zero forcing."

* Data Format

Each file defines a graph in edge list format, where the first row is the number of vertices and edges "V E" and each further row defines an edge in the form "v_1 v_2".

** Example Graph: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_graph][Butterfly Graph]]

See https://github.com/derekmikesell/improved_zero_forcing/blob/master/butterfly.edg for what the file would look like for the butterfly graph with vertices 0,...,4.

* Results Format

Results are in LaTeX table format. The folder name indicates the algorithm used, while the file name indicates the graph set corresponding to the results.
